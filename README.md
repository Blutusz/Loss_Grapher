# Loss Grapher

This simple HTML tool visualizes training loss values from your logs. Upload a log, and it plots the loss over training steps.

## Sample Images

You can overlay sample images generated during training:

1. Name image files so that the first number in the filename is the training step, e.g. `step_1000_1.png` or `1000-image.png`.
2. Click **Upload Samples** and select one or more images. You can pick multiple files at once.
3. Markers will appear on the loss chart at steps where images are available. Click a marker to preview up to four images for that step.

Use the HTML file directly in your browser to analyze your logs.
